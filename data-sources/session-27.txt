data sources

The data in the any providers (aws, azure, gcp..) changes dynamically

Data source is used to query the data dynamically from the providers

take an ece-instance's ami id and get all the info

if any changes pacthes happend, the ami-id changes regularly

to catch or fetch the change in the ami-id, we can make use of data-source
